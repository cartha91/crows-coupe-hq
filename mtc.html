      <h2>Ealley</h2>
      <p>Ealley is a wonderful and beautiful wife of Cartha, the lead reviewer and game designer of Crows Coupe. 
        She is a newcomer to the world of anime and video games, but she is eager to learn and explore. She will 
        be providing outside opinions on animes and video games as the one in the group without a history in the genre. 
        This will provide non-biased and informed reviews for those new or wanting to step into the anime genre but don't 
        know where to start.

        Ealley is also an amazingly talented artist with unmatched creativity and interest. She handles the graphic design 
        for Crows Coupe Headquarters, creating stunning visuals and logos for the website, YouTube channel, and game projects.
